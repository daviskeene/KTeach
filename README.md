# KTeach

KTeach is a Kotlin based learning service to allow classrooms to push out coding assignments in Kotlin. Inspired by the lack of homework assignments in CS 199, I wanted to use Kotlin to create a service that professors can use to create and assign Kotlin assignments in an intuitive and easy fashion.

KTeach is designed to be a simple web application running on a Kotlin powered web API. Using kTor, Google Cloud and other services, I plan on making an application with basic user authentication, an interface for both students and teachers, and a way for teachers to push out code and for sudents to submit it.

KTeach is now live! Check it out at http://kteach.live.

If you want to join an example classroom to get started and try out some basic Kotlin assignments, the classroom code is MBYGJF. Feel free to try to complete some of the assignments!
