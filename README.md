KTeach is my final project idea pitch for CS 199-KT at UIUC. 
What is KTeach?
-
KTeach is a Kotlin based learning service to allow classrooms to push out coding assignments in Kotlin. Inspired by the lack of homework assignments in CS 199, I wanted to use Kotlin to create a service that professors can use to create and assign Kotlin assignments in an intuitive and easy fashion.

KTeach is designed to be a simple web application running on a Kotlin powered web API. Using kTor, Google Cloud and other services, I plan on making an application with basic user authentication, an interface for both students and teachers, and a way for teachers to push out code and for sudents to submit it.

For more information, the code is (going to be) well documented, and my overall design process will be recorded in the seperate DEVELOPMENT.md file.
