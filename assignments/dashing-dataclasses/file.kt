/*
Data Classes are important data structures in Kotlin. They are powerful tools that allow us to encapsulate data.
Data Classes are similar to Java Classes, although they construct everything that we need for us!

We don't have to worry about getters and setters, or setting up an explicit constructor.

Example:
-----------------
data class Student(val name: String, var grade: Float)
-----------------
This is all we need!

Your task is to create a data class that represents a Virus.

In the scope of the assignment, viruses have a name (string), numberInfected attribute (int) and rate (float).
Viruses cannot change their name, but they can change their rate of infection and the number of people infected.
Viruses should also have a method called infect() that increases their number of infected by one.
*/

// Declare your data class below
// data class Virus()

//fun main() {
    // Test your data class here
//}
